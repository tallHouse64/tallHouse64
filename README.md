Hello, 
I made a Github finally!
- I'm interested in "inventing" new ideas that havent been done before and games.
- I'm can program in C, JavaScript, some V, and have done a little php.
- You can email me on tallhouse64@protonmail.com
- I'm christian, it's more fun than you think!

tallHouse64/tallHouse64 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
